Your mod folder should be structured in a way that is easy to use and functions properly

@XYZ_your_mod.pbo\files go here
@mod_name\data\textures
@mod_name\data\scripts
@mod_name\config.cpp

config.cpp, cfgPatches.hpp, cfgMods.hpp, cfgVehicles.hpp, cfgWeapons.hpp, cfgUnitInsignia.hpp all go in the @mod_name folder.
Organization is key so keeping similar items grouped in different folders is a good idea (models, images, scripts).

File types should include the full path name from the root folder indicated with a \ followed by the full path and ending with the file type.
hiddenSelectionsTextures[] = "\mod_name\image_folder\icon.paa";
